<h4>Concept:</h4>
<ul>
<li>While the whole plan was to be using a forums system, however now we've changed the plan to build everything from the ground up. This does add the complication of having to design and develop a whole active forums system.</li>
 <br>
<li>The concept of this idea is to have a one system to manage your entire site. Without using multiple systems, and multiple logins even for the group in command. This will allow management of the website, to be simple, and seamless.</li>
<br>
<li>The concept is to have many things; mainly things to benefit groups that are in-need of a useful website that is not only to manage user rank, permissions, roles, and position in the group. It is to also be a place of discussion with a full forums system base. </li>
